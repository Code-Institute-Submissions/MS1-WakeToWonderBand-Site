    <h2>About</h2>

      Wake to Wonder hail from Gauteng, South Africa, and have been stirring up
      a storm since they were established in August 2007. Their innovative
      tunes, mixing melodic vocals with powerhouse drums, in-your-face guitar
      leads and melodies and dynamic bass riffs have put them on the map in the
      South African music scene as well as generated a steadily-growing
      international footprint for the band internationally. Wake to Wonder
      completed their debut album entitled SALUBRIOUS in 2010 and promoted the
      album with a two month national tour during February 2010. This included
      dates in Pinetown, Durban, East London, Cape Town, Potchefstroom, Secunda,
      Welkom, Bloemfontein as well as their home town of Vanderbijlpark. This
      also sparked many mini tours throughout the country and landed the band on
      many major South African Festivals such as Woodstock, Thornfest "the
      camp", Seasons Wither, Aardklop, Jo'Burg Burning and many more. The have
      performed alongside some of SA's top bands as well as international acts,

      10 for 16 weeks, the band's second release, "Discord in Harmony" shot
      straight into the top 10 Homebrew charts at number 3 position. "Mr Potato
