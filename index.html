      <p>
        Wake to Wonder hail from Gauteng, South Africa, and have been stirring
        up a storm since they were established in August 2007. Their innovative
        tunes, mixing melodic vocals with powerhouse drums, in-your-face guitar
        leads and melodies and dynamic bass riffs have put them on the map in
        the South African music scene as well as generated a steadily-growing
        international footprint for the band internationally. Wake to Wonder
        completed their debut album entitled SALUBRIOUS in 2010 and promoted the
        album with a two month national tour during February 2010. This included
        dates in Pinetown, Durban, East London, Cape Town, Potchefstroom,
        Secunda, Welkom, Bloemfontein as well as their home town of
        Vanderbijlpark. This also sparked many mini tours throughout the country
        and landed the band on many major South African Festivals such as
        Woodstock, Thornfest "the camp", Seasons Wither, Aardklop, Jo'Burg
        Burning and many more. The have performed alongside some of SA's top
        bands as well as international acts, most notably the platinum-selling

        summer"), Protest the hero, Unearth as well as Platinum selling pop rock
        outfit from Ireland ‘Ash’. The band's strong repertoire and dynamic

        stations across the country. The band's "Mr Potato Man" shot to number 1
        position on the Highveld Homebrew charts and featured in the top 10 for
        16 weeks, the band's second release, "Discord in Harmony" shot straight
        into the top 10 Homebrew charts at number 3 position. "Mr Potato Man"
        peaked on Ryan Seacrest's Top 8 at 8 chart show in third position as
