# **Wake to Wonder**

**Milestone Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute**

This site is to help promote a South African Rock Band by increasing their status by showcasing their already extensive library of Music and Videos along with touring. This site focuses on the Band, Band Members, Videos with Links and a submission form in order to enquire about booking the Band.

In Short:

- Increase Band bookings
- Promote Band Awareness

# **UX**

This website has been laid out in a scrollable format and the user can easily navigate through the page. This is a fun website and is aimed at users who are into rock music and are interested in booking a rock band. It is aimed at a large audience and whilst visiting this site they will be introduced to a broader perspective of the bands music. As a user to this site i would expect to see, Images/Videos of the Band, contact/enquiry to book and to connect with the Band.

## User Stories

- As a fan and friend of W2W I wanted to create a site where I could discover more of their music
- As an avid photographer I wanted to include images to capture the users into seeing action shots
- As a fan of rock music I wanted the user to be able to connect through social Links
- If I was a new visitor to this site I would like to find out more about this band and how I could enquire about booking them
- I wanted the user to be able to browse this site on any device which I am pretty sure I have achieved

# **Features**

My website has 5 different sections to navigate through on a sticky Nav bar which collapses when view on a tablet or mobile all images are responsive. I have gone for a single page scrollable website which i think works better for a band all sections are linked and are functional

- Home - This section has 3 large pics of the Band on a carousel which moves automatically or it can be selected by the user to move to the next page.
- About - This section gives a brief overview of the Band and some of their tours etc. I wanted to keep it brief in order not to loose the readers interested
- Band - This section has 4 pics in a row of each member with their names and what instrument they play, I used bootstrap grid for this
- Videos - This section has a music video that the Band released and is playable directly from the site, there is a link below the video to take the user to a you tube playlist of the band, i set this so it would open in a seperate page so the user can still continue to browse this site
- Contact - This section has a form that if the user is interested can enter their details to enquire about booking the band, the submit button takes the user to an image
- Footer - Very simple footer with social links of the band, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and you tube

## Features left to implement

# **Strategy**

I set out to make this an enjoyable site to visit as well as an easy site to navigate. I wanted to keep it simple but still enough on the page to navigate through

# **Scope**

For every new or old music lover, I wanted to create an easy friendly navigatable site that has ease of access and shows the users what the band is all about

# **Structure**

This website has been laid out in a way as to get a feel for who the band are by visual and then you get to know about the band and then listen to their music. The nav bar is always available for quick and easy navigation

# **Skeleton**

I used Balsamiq to create my wireframes - first time I have used Balsamiq and i found it to be a very good tool

# **Surface**

# **Technologies Used**

- Html - Html was used to create the layout of the website
- CSS - CSS was used to syle my website
- Balsamiq Wireframes - Balsamiq was used to create wireframes to get an idea of layout
- https://getbootstrap.com/ - I used bootstrap for responsivness and created an image carousel, I also used the CDN for this project and Bootstrap Grid
- W3Schools - I found W3Schools extremelly helpful with this project and I used this responsive form https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_form_responsive i altered it a bit to suit my website
- https://fontawesome.com
- https://fonts.google.com/ - I used Google fonts for my fonts and i used "Pangolin" throughout the entire page as i think it works well with the site

# **Testing**

I used several different browsers to test my site, namely Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge, Chrome was absolutely fine, however Firefox and Edge, my Social links at the bottom didnt work out, i Tried putting my code through Validator and found little errors but couldnt fix this issue. The responsiveness works well across these browsers, i also tested this on Google Pixel 3, Samsung Tablet SMTM85 and the page responded well. I also used Dev tools to inspect on the different devices that are available and on an ipad pro the images go vertically but are still aligned nicely.
